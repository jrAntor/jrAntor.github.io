I was scrolling through my LinkedIn feed (scrolling is a deal breaker* of course) one evening and I came along a post from  [freecodeCamp ](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) about  [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)'s 24 days long coding challenge which will be given as daily basis. As I want to learn and understand JavaScript properly, I signed up for that event. And honestly it was helpful and exciting to approach a new problem every day and after some brainstorming I was able to solve almost (I have a few unfinished problems) all of the problems. So, here's a list of solutions I have solved. And I will update the unfinished ones as soon as they are done.
